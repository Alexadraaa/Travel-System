We're creating a mobile app using Tkinter for its simplicity, aiming to cover all user cases like logging in, registering, browsing businesses, and making bookings. The project's directory structure, including GUI, Models, Services, and Database, ensures organized code and facilitates future modifications. By modularizing our code, we can easily manage different aspects of the app separately, promoting reusability and scalability. Tkinter's ease of use aligns with our goal of creating a user-friendly interface, making it suitable for beginners and ensuring a smooth development process.
